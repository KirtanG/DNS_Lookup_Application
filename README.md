# DNS Lookup Application using Python and Tkinter

**Description:**

This is a simple DNS lookup tool that fetches the IP address(es) (if the domain name resolves to an IP address) of any website using the built-in socket library and parses the domain name using urllib. You can also save the IP address(es) to a plain text file.

The GUI was created with the help of <a href="https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer">Tkinter Designer</a> and Figma. The Figma design can be found <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/veN6u59O2Gq8Rh9T5ZKDdR/GUI-Domain-name?node-id=0-1&t=NvvvzCIoLS17HzDg-1">here</a>.
